Development on this library has slowed down, in favor of working on TensorTrade - a framework for trading with RL: https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade

If you'd like to learn more about how we created this agent, check out the Medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-bitcoin-trading-bots-that-dont-lose-money-2e7165fb0b29

Later, we optimized this repo using feature engineering, statistical modeling, and Bayesian optimization, check it out:

# Getting Started

### How to find out if you have nVIDIA GPU?

Linux:

```bash
sudo lspci | grep -i --color 'vga\|3d\|2d' | grep -i nvidia
```

If this returns anything, then you should have an nVIDIA card.

### Basic usage

The first thing you will need to do to get started is install the requirements. If your system has an nVIDIA GPU that you should start by using:

```bash
cd "path-of-your-cloned-rl-trader-dir"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

More information regarding how you can take advantage of your GPU while using docker: https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker

If you have another type of GPU or you simply want to use your CPU, use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.no-gpu.txt
```

Update your current static files, that are used by default:

```bash
 python ./cli.py update-static-data
```

Afterwards you can simply see the currently available options:

```bash
python ./cli.py --help
```

or simply run the project with default options:

```bash
python ./cli.py optimize
```

If you have a standard set of configs you want to run the trader against, you can specify a config file to load configuration from. Rename config/config.ini.dist to config/config.ini and run

```bash
python ./cli.py --from-config config/config.ini optimize
```

```bash
python ./cli.py optimize
```

### Testing with vagrant

Start the vagrant box using:

```bash
vagrant up
```

Code will be located at /vagrant. Play and/or test with whatever package you wish.
Note: With vagrant you cannot take full advantage of your GPU, so is mainly for testing purposes

### Testing with docker

If you want to run everything within a docker container, then just use:

```bash
./run-with-docker (cpu|gpu) (yes|no) optimize
```

- cpu - start the container using CPU requirements
- gpu - start the container using GPU requirements
- yes | no - start or not a local postgres container
  Note: in case using yes as second argument, use

```bash
python ./ cli.py --params-db-path "postgres://rl_trader:rl_trader@localhost" optimize
```

The database and it's data are pesisted under `data/postgres` locally.

If you want to spin a docker test environment:

```bash
./run-with-docker (cpu|gpu) (yes|no)
```

If you want to run existing tests, then just use:

```bash
./run-tests-with-docker
```

# Fire up a local docker dev environment

```bash
./dev-with-docker
```

# Windows 10 installation, no CUDA installation needed

```bash
conda create --name rltrader python=3.6.8 pip git
```
```bash
conda activate rltrader
```
```bash
conda install tensorflow-gpu
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader
```
```bash
pip install -r RLTrader/requirements.txt
```

# Optimizing, Training, and Testing

While you could just let the agent train and run with the default PPO2 hyper-parameters, your agent would likely not be very profitable. The `stable-baselines` library provides a great set of default parameters that work for most problem domains, but we need to better.

To do this, you will need to run `optimize.py`.

```bash
python ./optimize.py
```

This can take a while (hours to days depending on your hardware setup), but over time it will print to the console as trials are completed. Once a trial is completed, it will be stored in `./data/params.db`, an SQLite database, from which we can pull hyper-parameters to train our agent.

From there, agents will be trained using the best set of hyper-parameters, and later tested on completely new data to verify the generalization of the algorithm.

Feel free to ask any questions in the Discord!

# Google Colab
Enter and run the following snippet in the first cell to load RLTrader into a Google Colab environment. Don't forget to set hardware acceleration to GPU to speed up training! 

```
!git init && git remote add origin https://github.com/notadamking/RLTrader.git && git pull origin master
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Common troubleshooting

##### The specified module could not be found.

Normally this is caused by missing mpi module. You should install it according to your platorm.
